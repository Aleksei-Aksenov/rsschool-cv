About myself:

I'm 32 years. I have extensive experience in the oil refining industry. I have worked at an oil refinery for 10 years, until one day I realized that this job brings me good income, but not satisfaction. I wanted to do something in which I would have desire to develop and become better day by day. That's why I'm here. Coding is what really turns me on. My goal is to become a full stack developer. I started the path to this goal in 2022 by enrolling in back-end development courses, which I had successfully been completed after 9 months of study. Now I am actively studying front-end development. I understand that you should not expect quick results, but as you know, only the walking one will master the road.
